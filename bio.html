	<p> Who am I? </p> 
	<div class = "description">
	<p> I'm a junior at Tufts who is passionate about biotechnology, advocating for women in tech, and running. Outside of academics, I am an officer for WiCS, an introductory Computer Science TA and an instructor for Tufts Girls of Code. I also teach high school students about bioinformatics and am inolved in computational biology research. Somehow I also find time to  train for a half marathon. </p>

	<p> I've done some really interesting work since coming to college. Feel free to check out my resume or read about my side projects. Hope you find something interesting! </p>
