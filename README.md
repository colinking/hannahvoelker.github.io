My personal portfolio, following the specifications for Comp 20.

### Correctly implemented:
* Only used HTML5 and CSS. Google web fonts used, checked with Ming first.
* Resume page: includes full name, education, professional experience, skills, and activites.
* Bio: A short biography of me. 
* index: includes image of me, link to my resume and my bio.
* Did not use any of the "banned" things (eg, no frames, styling elements/attributes, absolute image urls, bootstrap, other people's CSS, Javascript/jquery). All work, aside from the google fonts, is my own and my idea. The only reference I used was the html color picker from Google, Google fonts, and W3school's CSS page to give me tips when I was stuck.

### Incorrectly implemented:
* I did not incorrectly implement anything. I did, however, add a few extra pages in order to really make it the site I want to show to employers. I had a personal site prior to this assignment, but I was using a template. 

### How long did it take to implement?
I believe I spent about two hours on the bulk of the required portion. Another 2 hours was spent intermittently cleaning up some things, as well as implementing the project page. 

### Did I collaborate with anyone?
I did chat with Ming and a couple of the TA's on some advice regarding the transition from using a template to completely scrapping everything and going from scratch (for me, this was hard. my former site looked pretty, but it wasn't unique). I had some questions about what was allowed for fonts. I didn't speak to anyone else about my project, but I may end up helping another student on theirs since I am done the bare minimum on 1/25.
