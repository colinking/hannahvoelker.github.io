<div class = "description">
I'm a junior at Tufts who is passionate about biotechnology, web development, advocating for women in tech, and running. <br>
Outside of academics, I am an officer for WiCS, an introductory Computer Science TA and an instructor for Tufts Girls of Code. <br>
 I also teach high school students about bioinformatics and am inolved in computational biology research. Somehow I also find time to recover from injury and train for a half marathon. <br> <br>

I've done some really interesting work since coming to college. Feel free to check out my resume or read about my side projects. Hope you find something interesting!
