<p> I'm a junior at Tufts who is passionate about biotechnology, web development, advocating for women in tech, and running. 
    Outside of academics, I am an officer for WiCS, an introductory Computer Science TA and an instructor for Tufts Girls of Code. 
    I also teach high school students about bioinformatics and am inolved in computational biology research. Somehow I also find time to recover from injury and train for a half marathon.
